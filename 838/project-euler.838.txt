Problem 838

Not Coprime

Let f(N) 
be the smallest positive integer that is not coprime to any positive integer
n <= N whose least significant digit is 3.

For example
  f(40) = 3 * 13 * 23 = 897
since it is not coprime to any of 3, 13, 23, 33. By taking the natural
logarithm (log to base e) we obtain
  ln(f(4)) = ln(897) ~= 6.799056
when rounded to six digits after the decimal point.

You are also given
  ln(f(2800)) = 715.019

Find f(10 ** 6).
Enter its natural logarithm rounded to six digits after the decimal point.
