Problem 47

Distinct primes factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
  14 = 2 × 7 (prime factors 2 and 7)
  15 = 3 × 5 (prime factors 3 and 5)

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
  644 = 2² ×  7 × 23 (prime factors 2,  7 and 23)
  645 = 3  ×  5 × 43 (prime factors 3,  5 and 43)
  646 = 2  × 17 × 19 (prime factors 2, 17 and 19)

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors
each. What is the first of these numbers?
