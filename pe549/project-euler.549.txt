Problem 549

Divisibility of Factorials

The smallest number m such that 10 divides m! is m=5.
The smallest number m such that 25 divides m! is m=10.

Let s(n) be the smallest number m such that n divides m!.

So
  s(10) = 5
  s(25) = 10

Let S(n) = sum(s(i) | 2 <= i <= n).

You are given that
  S(100)=2012.

Find S(10^8).
