Problem 965

Expected Minimal Fractional Value

Let {x} denote the fractional part of a real number x.

Define f_N(x) to be the minimal value of {n*x} for integer n satisfying 0 < n < N.
Further define F(N) to be the expected value of f_N(x) when x is sampled uniformly in [0, 1].

You are given
  F(1)   = 1/2
  F(4)   = 1/4
  F(10) ~= 0.1319444444444

Find F(10**4) and give your answer rounded to 13 digits after the decimal point.
